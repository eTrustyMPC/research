# Dedicated space for any project-related research

Just to keep everything in one place. No specific project structure, or restrictions about content.

If you have something to share - this is the right place to do it.

Please write a few words about your your data when you commit a new content. This will help everyone to be aware about what things we have have now, and what thing can become our "next big thing" :)
