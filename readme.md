# Dedicated space for any project-related research

Just to keep everything in one place. No specific project structure, or restrictions about content.

If you have something to share - this repo is for you.

Also there is a good idea to write a few words about your content in readme: this will help everyone to be aware about where we are now and what we are going to do next.
